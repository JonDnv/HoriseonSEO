# HoriseonSEO

## Description

Refactoring the website for Horiseon in order to improve code and to make site more accessible.

Updated the HTML Title to "Horiseon Search Engine Optimization"
Fixed "Search Engine Optimization href so it moved page to that section.
Line 68 - Removed img closing tag as it is self-closing.
Added "alt" to all images for accessibility.
